/**
 * This module defines the custom exception classes used by the interpreter to represent various
 * error conditions that can occur during interpretation.
 *
 * IPP: You can freely modify this file and add any additional exception classes.
 *      However, the InterpreterError class must be used as a base for any exceptions that control
 *      the outcome of the interpretation (i.e., those that are caught in solint.php and cause
 *      the interpreter to exit with a specific error code).

 * Author: Ondřej Ondryáš <iondryas@fit.vut.cz>

 * AI usage notice: The author used OpenAI Codex to create the implementation of this
 *                  module based on its Python counterpart.
